### Data Flow
```
1. API Request → Background Task Created
2. WHOIS Lookup → Domain information retrieved
3. Subdomain Discovery:
   ├── Certificate Transparency (crt.sh)
   ├── HackerTarget API
   └── (Future: Knockpy brute-force)
4. Subdomain Merger → Deduplicate & validate
5. DNS Resolution → Resolve all record types concurrently
6. IP Organization → Map IPs to subdomains
7. Statistics → Calculate metrics
8. JSON Export → Store/return results
