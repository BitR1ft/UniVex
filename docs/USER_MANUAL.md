## 1. Introduction

AutoPenTest AI is an AI-powered penetration testing framework that automates the complete penetration testing lifecycle. The AI agent uses the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern to autonomously:

- Discover and enumerate targets
- Identify vulnerabilities
- Exploit weaknesses with human approval
- Perform post-exploitation enumeration
- Generate engagement summaries

The tool is designed for **authorized security testing only** and includes safety controls such as approval gates for dangerous operations and scope enforcement.

### Key Concepts

|------|-------------|
| **Project** | A penetration testing engagement targeting a specific host or network |
| **Phase** | The current stage of the engagement (Informational → Exploitation → Post-Exploitation → Complete) |
| **Agent** | The AI-powered assistant that executes the testing workflow |
| **Tool** | A security tool (Nmap, Nuclei, Metasploit, etc.) wrapped for agent use |
| **Attack Graph** | A Neo4j graph database that maps the entire attack surface |
| **MCP Server** | Model Context Protocol server that bridges the AI agent and security tools |

- **Chat** (`/chat`): Interactive AI agent interface
- **Graph** (`/graph`): Attack surface visualization

---

## 7. Creating a Project

### Project Configuration

When creating a project, you can configure:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Project identifier | "Corporate Network Pentest" |
| **Target** | IP address, hostname, or CIDR range | "192.168.1.0/24" |
| **Description** | Scope and objectives | "External assessment of web servers" |

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive names that identify the engagement
- Specify the exact target scope to prevent out-of-scope testing
- Document the authorization details in the description

---

## 8. Running the AI Agent

### Chat Interface

The chat interface is your primary way to interact with the AI agent.

#### Giving Instructions

You can give the agent natural language instructions:

```
# Reconnaissance
"Enumerate all subdomains for example.com"
"Scan ports 1-1000 on 10.10.10.3"
"Probe HTTP services and detect technologies"

# Exploitation
"Search for CVEs affecting Apache 2.4.49"
"Try to exploit CVE-2021-41773 on the target"
"Brute force SSH login with common credentials"

# Post-Exploitation
"Enumerate the system and find privilege escalation vectors"
"Look for the user flag"
"Try to escalate to root"
```

#### Understanding Agent Responses

The agent communicates its reasoning process:

- **THOUGHT**: The agent's analysis and decision-making
- **ACTION**: The tool being executed and why
- **OBSERVATION**: Results from tool execution
- **SUMMARY**: Final findings and recommendations

### Agent Phases

The agent operates in four phases:

| Phase | Purpose | Available Tools |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **INFORMATIONAL** | Reconnaissance and discovery | Naabu, Curl, Nuclei, Query Graph, Web Search |
| **EXPLOITATION** | Gaining access | Metasploit, Exploit Execute, Brute Force, Session Manager |
| **POST_EXPLOITATION** | Maximizing access | File Operations, System Enumeration, Privilege Escalation |
| **COMPLETE** | Reporting findings | Summary generation |

The agent transitions between phases based on progress. You can also guide phase transitions manually.

---

## 9. Reconnaissance Pipeline

AutoPenTest AI includes a 5-phase reconnaissance pipeline:

### Phase 1: Domain Discovery
- Subdomain enumeration
- DNS resolution
- Domain relationship mapping

### Phase 2: Port Scanning
- **Naabu**: Fast port scanning
- Service detection and version identification
- CDN detection
- Results stored in Neo4j graph

### Phase 3: HTTP Probing
- HTTP/HTTPS service probing
- Technology detection (Wappalyzer-style fingerprinting)
- TLS certificate inspection
- Security headers analysis

### Phase 4: Resource Enumeration
- **Katana**: Web crawler for endpoint discovery
- **GAU**: Historical URLs from web archives
- **Kiterunner**: API route brute-forcing

### Phase 5: Vulnerability Scanning
- **Nuclei**: Template-based vulnerability scanning
- CVE enrichment with CVSS scores
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
- Findings stored as graph nodes

---

## 10. Exploitation Phase

### Attack Path Router

The agent uses an intelligent attack path router that:
1. **Classifies** your intent into one of 10 attack categories
2. **Scores confidence** and suggests alternatives if classification is uncertain
3. **Generates** a step-by-step attack plan
4. **Requests approval** for dangerous operations

### Attack Categories

| Category | Risk Level | Requires Approval |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| CVE Exploitation | Critical | ✅ Yes |
| Brute Force | High | ✅ Yes |
| Web App Attack | High | No |
| Privilege Escalation | Critical | ✅ Yes |
| Lateral Movement | Critical | ✅ Yes |
| Password Spray | Medium | No |
| Social Engineering | Medium | No |
| Network Pivot | High | No |
| File Exfiltration | High | No |
| Persistence | Critical | No |

### Available Exploitation Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **ExploitExecuteTool** | Execute CVE exploits via Metasploit |
| **BruteForceTool** | Multi-service brute force (SSH, FTP, SMB, HTTP, etc.) |
| **MetasploitTool** | Search and configure Metasploit modules |
| **SessionManagerTool** | Manage Meterpreter and shell sessions |

---

## 11. Post-Exploitation

Once initial access is gained, the agent can:

### System Enumeration
- Operating system and kernel version
- User accounts and groups
- Network configuration and connections
- Running processes and services
- Installed software

### File Operations
- Download files from the target
- Upload tools to the target
- List directory contents
- Search for flags and sensitive files

### Privilege Escalation
- Automated `getsystem` attempts
- Suggest escalation exploits based on system enumeration
- Execute escalation modules
- Verify elevated privileges

### Credential Harvesting
- Extract discovered credentials
- Store credentials in the Neo4j graph
- Use credentials for lateral movement

---

## 12. Attack Graph Visualization

The attack graph provides a visual representation of the entire attack surface.

### Graph Node Types

The graph includes 17+ node types:
- **Domain**, **Subdomain**: DNS structure
- **IP**, **Port**, **Service**: Network topology
- **Technology**: Detected software and versions
- **Endpoint**, **Parameter**: Web application structure
- **Vulnerability**, **CVE**: Security findings
- **Session**, **Credential**: Access gained
- **MITRE Technique**: ATT&CK mapping

### Using the Graph Viewer

1. Navigate to the **Graph** tab in your project
2. The graph loads automatically with all discovered data
3. Use the controls to:
   - **Zoom**: Scroll wheel or pinch
   - **Pan**: Click and drag on empty space
   - **Inspect Node**: Click a node to see details in the Node Inspector panel
   - **Filter**: Use the Filter Panel to show/hide node types
   - **Export**: Export graph data for reporting

### Graph Filters

Filter the graph by:
- Node type (Domain, IP, Port, Vulnerability, etc.)
- Severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Phase (Reconnaissance, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation)

---

## 13. Approval Workflow

For dangerous operations, the agent requests human approval before proceeding.

### How It Works

1. The agent identifies an action that requires approval (e.g., CVE exploitation)
2. An **Approval Modal** appears in the chat interface
3. The modal shows:
   - **Action**: What the agent wants to do
   - **Risk Level**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
   - **Target**: The system being affected
   - **Justification**: Why the agent recommends this action
4. You can **Approve** or **Reject** the action
5. If approved, the agent proceeds; if rejected, it stops or finds alternatives

### Approval Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Exploitation** | Running CVE exploits, deploying payloads |
| **Credential Attacks** | Brute force, password spraying |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Kernel exploits, SUID abuse |
| **Lateral Movement** | Moving to other hosts via compromised credentials |

---

## 14. Agent Controls

### Real-Time Controls

| Control | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Stop** | `POST /agent/stop` | Halt agent execution immediately |
| **Resume** | `POST /agent/resume` | Resume a stopped agent |
| **Guide** | `POST /agent/guide` | Send real-time guidance to redirect the agent |
| **Approve** | `POST /agent/approve` | Approve or reject a pending action |

### Sending Guidance

You can redirect the agent mid-execution:

```
"Focus on the web application on port 8080 instead"
"Skip brute force and try the CVE-2021-41773 exploit"
"Enumerate SUID binaries for privilege escalation"
```

The agent incorporates your guidance into its next reasoning step.

## 17. Security & Ethics

### Authorized Use Only

> **⚠️ WARNING**: This framework is designed exclusively for **authorized penetration testing**. Unauthorized use against systems you do not own or have explicit written permission to test is **illegal and unethical**.

### Safety Controls

AutoPenTest AI includes multiple safety mechanisms:

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Approval Gates** | Dangerous operations require explicit human approval |
| **Phase Gating** | Exploitation tools are only available after reconnaissance |
| **Scope Enforcement** | Agent is restricted to configured target scope |
| **Audit Logging** | All actions are logged for review and compliance |
| **Stop Controls** | Agent can be halted immediately at any time |
| **Live Guidance** | Redirect agent behavior in real-time |

### Best Practices

1. **Always** obtain written authorization before testing
2. **Define scope** clearly in the project configuration
3. **Review** approval requests carefully before approving
4. **Monitor** agent activity via the chat interface
5. **Document** findings and remediation for the target organization
6. **Clean up** any artifacts left on target systems after testing

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover vulnerabilities during authorized testing:
1. Document findings with evidence
2. Report to the system owner through agreed-upon channels
3. Provide remediation guidance
4. Allow reasonable time for fixes before any public disclosure
5. Follow your organization's disclosure policy

## 18. FAQ

**Q: Which LLM provider should I use?**
A: Both OpenAI (GPT-4) and Anthropic (Claude) are supported. GPT-4 Turbo is recommended for the best balance of capability and speed.

**Q: Can I test multiple targets simultaneously?**
A: v1.0 supports one target per project. Multi-target campaigns are planned for Year 2.

**Q: Does the agent need internet access?**
A: The AI agent needs internet access for LLM API calls and optional web search (Tavily). Security tools can run in isolated networks.

**Q: How do I add custom tools?**
A: Create a new tool class extending `BaseTool` in `backend/app/agent/tools/`, implement the `execute()` method, and register it in the `ToolRegistry`. See existing tools for examples.

**Q: What happens if the agent gets stuck?**
A: Use the **Stop** control to halt the agent, then use **Guide** to redirect it, or **Resume** with new instructions.

**Q: Is my data stored securely?**
A: Project data is stored in PostgreSQL (encrypted at rest with database-level encryption) and Neo4j. API keys are stored in environment variables, never in code. All API endpoints use JWT authentication.

**Q: Can I export the attack graph?**
A: Yes, use the **Graph Export** feature in the dashboard to export graph data in JSON format for reporting.

**Q: How accurate is the intent classification?**
A: v1.0 uses keyword-based classification with confidence scoring. The system reports its confidence level and suggests alternatives when uncertain. ML-based classification is planned for Year 2.
